# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">




<font size="6"> ðŸŒ±  I am Tanmoy Sarker.

<font size="6"> I am a Mobile Application Developer for more than three years now. I mostly worked with JavaScript and React Native. But it's been quite some time since i started working with Flutter.

<font size="6"> ðŸ¤” If i have to choose between React Native and Flutter, i won't choose because it really doesn't matter. The only thing matters is what you are trying to acheive.

<font size="6"> ðŸ”­ I want to make a great app which will help lot of people. So, feel free to share if anyone have any idea. I will be happy to work with that if that's interesting enough. I hope i will contribute a lot in the upcoming times. Cheers ðŸ˜„  and happy coding.</font>
